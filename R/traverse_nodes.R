#' @title Traverse Nodes and Create Dependency Matrix
#'
#' @description
#' Creates a dependency matrix based on the relationships between nodes provided.
#'
#' @details
#' Given a list of nodes, each represented by a named list with 'x' (inputs) and 'y' (outputs) components,
#' this function generates a dependency matrix. The matrix indicates dependencies between nodes, where a value of
#' 1 indicates that a node depends on another node. Dependencies are determined by checking if any of the inputs
#' of a node are outputs of another node. The resulting matrix provides insights into the order in which nodes
#' should be executed in a data processing or analysis pipeline.
#'
#' @param nodes (list) A list of nodes, where each node is represented by a named list with 'x' (inputs) and 'y' (outputs) components.
#'
#' @return Returns a dependency matrix indicating relationships between nodes, where 1 indicates dependency and
#' 0 indicates no dependency. Each row indicates a different node, and the dependency relationship to the nodes in the columns.
