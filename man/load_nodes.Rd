\description{

}
\details{
This function takes the path to a configuration file (default is "R/nodes.R") and creates a new environment (`objects`).
It then sources the specified file, executing its contents within the new environment. The function selects only objects
with the class 'node' from the environment, which are typically used to represent nodes in a data processing or analysis
pipeline. These nodes can include various data processing functions or other objects relevant to the workflow.
